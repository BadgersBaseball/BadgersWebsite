        <h2>Our Coach</h2>
        <h3>Kevin Owens</h3>
        <p>
          Kevin Owens is entering his 15th year in total coaching. Kevin has
          coached levels ranging from 8U to the Junior College Level. At the age
          of 19, he got his start during his college baseball days as an
          Assistant Summer Baseball Coach for Narrows Baseball Academy 18U. He
          was also an Assistant Coach in Augusta, GA for the Augusta Barons 18U
          during his latter years of college. He was a Volunteer Assistant in
          year 1 and in year 2 named Head Assistant Baseball Coach at Everett
          Community College between 2011 and 2012. During his two years he
          helped guide the Everett Trojans in back to back NWAAC Regional
          Tournament Appearances including a final 4 finish in 2012. In 2011 and
          2012 both teams finished as Co-Champions of the NWAC North Division.
          During that time he was named the Academy hitting Instructor for Laces
          Baseball out of Everett running the offense for teams ranging from 13
          to 18. After a 3 year coaching break where Kevin focussed on his soon
          to be family, he decided to get back into the coaching world being
          hired as Head Varsity Baseball Coach for Peninsula High School from
          2016-2018. There are a handful of players from those years still
          active in college baseball today. Choosing to focus on family again
          after 2018, Kevin began working with his children Hudson and Wesley
          and their baseball lives. In 2020 Kevin and his children moved to
          Puyallup coaching Little League Baseball for which he's found more
          passion than he ever thought possible. Kevin looks forward to years of
          helping young kids grow their lives through the game of baseball. His
          goal is to give players a compeititive Travel Ball experience while
          making it affordable for families.
