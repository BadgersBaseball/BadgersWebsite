          <h3>Kevin</h3>
          <p>
            Kevin Owens is entering his 15th year in total coaching. Kevin has
            coached levels ranging from 8U to the Junior College Level. At the
            age of 19, he got his start during his college baseball days as an
            Assistant Summer Baseball Coach for Narrows Baseball Academy 18U. He
            was also an Assistant Coach in Augusta, GA for the Augusta Barons
            18U during his latter years of college. He was a Volunteer Assistant
            in year 1 and in year 2 named Head Assistant Baseball Coach at
            Everett Community College between 2011 and 2012. During his two
            years he helped guide the Everett Trojans in back to back NWAAC
            Regional Tournament Appearances including a final 4 finish in 2012.
            In 2011 and 2012 both teams finished as Co-Champions of the NWAC
            North Division. During that time he was named the Academy hitting
            Instructor for Laces Baseball out of Everett running the offense for
            teams ranging from 13 to 18. After a 3 year coaching break where
            Kevin focussed on his soon to be family, he decided to get back into
            the coaching world being hired as Head Varsity Baseball Coach for
            Peninsula High School from 2016-2018. There are a handful of players
            from those years still active in college baseball today. Choosing to
            focus on family again after 2018, Kevin began working with his
            children Hudson and Wesley and their baseball lives. In 2020 Kevin
            and his children moved to Puyallup coaching Little League Baseball
            for which he's found more passion than he ever thought possible.
            Kevin looks forward to years of helping young kids grow their lives
            through the game of baseball. His goal is to give players a
            compeititive Travel Ball experience while making it affordable for
            families.
