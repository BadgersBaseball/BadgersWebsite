        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Badgers Baseball was formed in 2022 after a group of parents and
          talented players decided they wanted to create a space to experience
          competitive baseball a little differently. Youth baseball is becoming
          a lucrative business in many ways, and Badgers Baseball would like to
          bring the focus back to the game and its players.
          <br />
          <br />
          Badgers Baseball wants kids to be able to play any sport they want to
          without having to commit to only one path; we believe a well rounded
          athlete who has both physical and mental strength will result from
          this opportunity.
          <br />
          <br />
          Badgers Baseball strives to provide more than just baseball drills and
          a winning team: Our goal is to teach our players how to compete, how
          to stand up to adversity successfully, and how to be a supportive
          teammate. Badgers Baseball is a nonprofit organization.
